                    Hello! My name is Joe and I am twenty years old. I live in Burnsville, Minnesota. I graduated in 2016 from the Academy of Holy Angels located in Richfield, Minnesota. I am currently attending Normandale Community College and am planning on pursuing my education at the University of Minnesota.

                <br>
                <p>Growing up I loved to play competetive sports like hockey and lacrosse. Some of my favorite hobbies include swimming, making music, gaming, and cooking. I love spending time with two golden retrievers, bear and daisy. I have recently become interested in learning how to code. </p>

                <p>I am very grateful that I found the UMN coding bootcamp because of the opportunities they provide. Although seriously challenging, completeing this course will be a big accomplishment and i am excited for what is to come. I hope to one day learn how to develop games to become an indie developer.  </p>
